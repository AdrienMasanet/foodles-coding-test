# Hello ðŸ˜Š This is my solution to the coding test for Foodles.

## Here is the exercice

```
1) Write a function that takes as input (sentence: String, n: Number)
and returns a list of size `n` where each element contains a word and and the frequency of that word in `sentence`
This list should be sorted by decreasing frequency and alphabetical order in case of tie.

Example:
Input: ("baz bar foo foo zblah zblah zblah baz toto bar", 3)
Output:
[
   ("zblah", 3),
   ("bar", 2),
   ("baz", 2),
]

2) Write tests for the function you just wrote

You are free to chose the programming language that you are the most comfortable with.
```

</br>

## Tools I used

I chose to use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://fr.reactjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to solve this exercise and tests were written using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
</br>
</br>

## How it works

The WordsOccurences.tsx file is a React component that is called in App.tsx. This React component shows the original sentence and the list of words computed by countOccurences() by displaying their string and their count.
</br>
</br>
WordsOccurences component calls the function countOccurences() that I wrote to solve the problem.
</br>
</br>
The function countOccurences is located under utils/WordsOccurences.tsx, and the tests for this function are located under tests/WordsOccurences.test.tsx
</br>
</br>
I added a lot of comments on purpose to better explain the code inside the countOccurences function.
</br>
</br>

## How to use

To run the tests, you can use the following command :

```
npm run test
```

To run the program, you can use the following command :

```
npm run start
```

or

```
npm run dev
```
